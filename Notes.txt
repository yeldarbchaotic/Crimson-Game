bs_button_state:
 0 - No buttons
 1 - Attacks, Skills, Items, Standby
 2 - Attacks
 3 - Skills
 4 - Items
 5 - Run Away

Effects: (Will be applied to "target")
 - ["health_mod",amount] (positive numbers to increase)
 - ["energy_mod",amount] (negative numbers to decrease)
 - ["stat_mod",stat_type,amount]
 - ["escape",percent_chance]

TO DO:
 - Add fainting. Maybe image becomes mostly transparent?
 - Come up with a different word for fainting.
 - Add Entity.receive_attack(self, attacker, attack)
   - Take damage, element, and attacker's strength into account.
 - Add automatic turn-change when all allies have moved.
 - Add Crimson.effect(self, effect, user, target)
 - Make bars change slowly.
   - Utilize Crimson.animating boolean.
   - Make the while running loop activate a function in Crimson for each frame.
 - Saving/Loading
 - Count frames, display 1.png, 2.png, etc. Maybe based on (frame / amount_of_frames_to_wait % image_count) + 1?

CURRENT BUGS:
 - Stats with modifiers don't fit correctly at high levels (left_panel)
 - Revival Tokens can be used on living allies. (add "target":"fainted")
 - Game closes on player defeat.
 - Menu stays open on load.

LONG-TERM TO DO:
 - Add something resembling a story.
 - Browse for picture to associate with current name. (Auto rename and put in images folder.)
 - Upload save information to MySQL, to be displayed on Crimson Domain.

NOTES:
 - Replace '[^\S\r]*[^\S\r](?=\r)' with nothing to remove whitespace before newlines.
 - Save on name change.
